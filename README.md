# FABM demonstration

***This is a snapshot of some work I did at University of Michigan CIGLR while working with folks from NOAA-GLERL. Some links may be broken, and the work was not completed before I left. Please do not rely on this as a guide for using FABM/GOTM/ERSEM/etc. I've placed this here for my own reference.***


**This repository and the associated wiki pages are not presented or endorsed by the developers of FABM, FVCOM, ERSEM, or GOTM. They only serve to demonstrate the setup and use of those softwares by CIGLR/GLERL staff for research purposes.**

This repository, along with the associated [FABM-demo wiki](https://github.com/ckingdon/FABM-demo/wiki), offers guidance for getting started with [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm). The ultimate goal is to develop a linked [FVCOM](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/fvcom/) - [ERSEM](https://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Models/ERSEM) model for Lake Erie. En route to achieving this goal there will be opportunities to explore other hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model systems of increasing complexity.

The [wiki](https://github.com/ckingdon/FABM-demo/wiki) provides details on model software configuration, installation, and use. Coarse instructions, example configuration files, and sample data files are provided. The wiki will be expanded as more information is gathered. 

Much of the information and many of the resources provided here have been borrowed, rearranged, repackaged, co-opted, or copied from the developers of FABM, FVCOM, ERSEM, GOTM, and related models. Links to source materials, references, and credit for previous work has been provided whenever possible.

If you find something that requires further explanation, feel free to contact ckingdon-noaa (Clayton) directly, or post comments via the [issues](https://github.com/ckingdon/FABM-tutorial/issues) page.
