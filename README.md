# FABM demonstration

**This repository and the associated wiki pages are not presented or endorsed by the developers of FABM, FVCOM, ERSEM, or GOTM. They only serve to demonstrate the setup and use of those softwares by CIGLR/GLERL staff for research purposes.**

This repository offers guidance for getting started with [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm). The ultimate goal is to develop a linked [FVCOM](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/fvcom/) - [ERSEM](https://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Models/ERSEM) model for Lake Erie. En route to achieving this goal there will be opportunities to explore other hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model systems of increasing complexity.

Coarse instructions, example configuration files, and sample data files are provided. The associated [FABM-demo wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-GLERL/FABM-demo/wiki) provides details on model software configuration, installation, and use. The wiki will be expanded as more information is gathered. 

Much of the information and many of the resources provided here have been borrowed, rearranged, repackaged, co-opted, or copied from the developers of FABM and related models. Links to source materials, references, and credit for previous work has been provided whenever possible.

If you find something that requires further explanation, feel free to contact ckingdon-noaa (Clayton) directly, or post comments via the [issues](https://github.com/NOAA-GLERL/FABM-tutorial/issues) page.
